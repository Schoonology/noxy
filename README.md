# Noxy

Whether due to poor searching skills or sheer lack of prior existence, Noxy exists because I couldn't find _anything_ to solve a simple problem: I'm sitting in a cafe or other public location where I cannot control the current port forwarding settings, and need a public IP to route clients from.

For most developers, a Public IP isn't strictly necessary. Every so often, however, it's _crucial_ to some application or development process. Enter **Noxy**.
